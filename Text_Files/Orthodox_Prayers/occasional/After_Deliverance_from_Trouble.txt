A Prayer After Deliverance from Trouble 

Almighty and merciful God, I humbly and heartily thank thee for thy loving-kindness and tender mercies, that thou hast heard my humble prayer and graciously vouchsafed to deliver me from my trouble and misery. Grant me, I beseech thee, thy helping grace, that I may obediently walk in thy holy commandments and lead a sober, righteous and godly way of life and ever remember thy mercies and the blessings which thou hast bestowed upon me the unworthy, that I may continually offer the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to thee, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen.
