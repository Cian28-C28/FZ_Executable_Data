A Prayer in Time of Trouble 

O God, the help and aid of all, who art righteous and merciful and who heareth the supplications of thy people, look down upon me, a miserable sinner, and have mercy on me, and deliver me from this trouble that doth beset me, for which, I know, I am deservedly suffering. I acknowledge and believe, O Lord, that all trials of this life are given by thee for our correction when we drift away from thee and disobey thy commandments. Deal with me not according to my sins but according to thy compassionate mercy, for I am the work of thy hands and thou knowest my weakness. Grant me, I beseech thee, the help of thy divine grace, and endow me with patience and strength to endure my tribulations with complete submission to thy holy will. Thou knowest my misery and suffering. To thee, my only hope and refuge, I flee for relief and comfort, trusting thine infinite love and compassion that, in due time, when thou knowest best, thou wilt deliver me from this trouble and turn my distress into comfort, when I shall rejoice in thy mercy and exalt and praise thy holy name, of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen.
