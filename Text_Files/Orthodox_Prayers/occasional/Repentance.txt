A Prayer of Repentance 

O Lord our God, good and merciful, I acknowledge all the sins which I have committed every day of my life, in thought, word and deed, in body and soul alike. I am heartily sorry that I have ever offended thee and I sincerely repent. With tears I humbly pray thee, O Lord: Of thy mercy forgive me all my past transgressions and absolve me from them. I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to amend my way of life and to sin no more, that I may walk in the way of the righteous and offer praise and glory to thy name, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
