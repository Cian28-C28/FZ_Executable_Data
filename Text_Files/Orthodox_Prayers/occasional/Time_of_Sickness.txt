A Prayer during a Time of Sickness 

O Lord Jesus Christ, our Saviour, the Physician of our souls and bodies, who didst become man and suffer death on the cross for our salvation and, through thy tender love and compassion, didst heal all manner of sickness and affliction: Do thou thyself, O Lord, visit me in my suffering and grant me grace and strength to bear this sickness with which I am afflicted, with Christian patience and submission to thy will, trusting in thy loving-kindness and tender mercy. Bless, I pray thee, the means used for my recovery and those who administer them. I know, O Lord, that I justly deserve any punishment thou mayest inflict upon me, for I have so often offended and sinned against thee in thought, word and deed. Therefore, I humbly pray thee, look favorably upon my weakness and deal with me not according to my sins but according to the multitude of thy mercies. Have compassion on me and let mercy and judgment meet and deliver me from the sickness and suffering which I am undergoing. Grant that my sickness may be the means of true repentance and amendment of life according to thy will, that I may spend the rest of my days in the love and fear of thee, that my soul, being helped by thy grace and sanctified by thy holy Mysteries, may be prepared for its passage into everlasting life and there, in the company of thy blessed saints, may praise and glorify thee with thine unoriginate Father and life-giving Spirit. Amen.
