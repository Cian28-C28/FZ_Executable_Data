A Prayer of Parents for Children (Also for relatives and friends) 

O God, our heavenly Father, who lovest mankind, and art most merciful and compassionate, have mercy upon thy servants, NN. [children, relatives], for whom I humbly pray, and whom I commend to thy gracious care and protection. Be thou, O God, their guide and guardian in all their endeavors, lead them in the path of thy truth, and draw them near to thee, that they may lead a godly and righteous life in thy love and fear, ever doing thy will in all things. Give them grace that they may be temperate, industrious, devout and charitable. Defend them against the assaults of the enemy, and grant them wisdom and strength to resist all the temptations and corruption of this life, and direct them in the way of salvation, through the grace and love toward mankind of thine only-begotten Son, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and by the intercessions of the most holy Theotokos, and all thy saints. Amen.
