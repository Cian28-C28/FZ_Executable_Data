A Prayer for Priests 

O Lord Jesus Christ, enkindle the hearts of all thy priests with the fire of zealous love for thee, that they may ever seek thy glory; give them strength that they may labor unceasingly in thine earthly vineyard for the salvation of our souls and for the glory of thine all-honorable and majestic name, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
