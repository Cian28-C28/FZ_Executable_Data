A Prayer of Children for Parents 

O God, our heavenly Father, bless my father and mother, my guardians, and those who are in authority over me, for their love and tender care for me and the benefits I receive at their hands. Help me, I pray thee, to be respectful and obedient to them in all things, according to thy will. Give me the grace to perform all my duties carefully and faithfully, to avoid undesirable company and influence and to resist all temptation that may come my way, that I may live a sober, righteous and godly life, ever praising and glorifying thee, together with thine only-begotten Son, and thine all-holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
