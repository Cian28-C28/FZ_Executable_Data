Prayer for Those Struggling with Addiction 

O Master, Lord Jesus Christ, our God, who hast said, “Without me, ye can do nothing”: Help me according to thy mercy, and leave me not to perish in my transgressions, nor allow me to follow the desires of the flesh over those of the spirit. I am thy creature and servant; disdain not the work of thy hands. Turn not away, be compassionate and merciful, neither scorn me, O Lord, as I am weak. Unto thee, my strength, my firm foundation, my refuge and my deliverer, have I now fled. Save me for thy mercy’s sake, and drive away from me every evil, filthy and wanton desire. For thou alone art holy, and thou alone art mighty and able to grant victory over every evil to those who call upon thy name and persevere to the end, and to thee do we ascribe glory, together with thine unoriginate Father and thy life-giving Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.
