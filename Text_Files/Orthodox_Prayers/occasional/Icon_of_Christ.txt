Prayer Before the Icon of Christ 

We venerate thine immaculate icon, O good One, and ask forgiveness of our transgressions, O Christ our God; for of thine own good will thou wast pleased to ascend the cross in the flesh, that thou mightest deliver those whom thou hast fashioned from bondage to the enemy. Wherefore, we cry aloud unto thee with thanksgiving: Thou hast filled all things with joy, O our Saviour, for thou didst come to save the world.
