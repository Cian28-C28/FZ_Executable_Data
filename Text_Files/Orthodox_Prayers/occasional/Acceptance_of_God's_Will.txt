Prayer for the Acceptance of God’s Will
by Saint Philaret of Moscow 

O Lord, I know not what to ask of thee. Thou alone knowest what my true needs are. Thou lovest me more than I myself know how to love. Help me to see my real needs which are concealed from me. I dare not ask for either a cross or a consolation. I can only wait on thee. My heart is open to thee. Visit and help me for thy great mercy’s sake. Strike me and heal me, cast me down and raise me up. I worship in silence thy holy will and thine inscrutable ways. I offer myself as a sacrifice to thee. I put all my trust in thee. I have no other desire than to fulfill thy will. Teach me how to pray. Pray thou thyself within me. Amen.
