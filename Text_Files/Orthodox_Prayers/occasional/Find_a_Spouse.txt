A Prayer to Find a Spouse 

All-good and merciful Lord, I know that any enduring happiness in my life dependeth upon my wholehearted love for thee and upon keeping thy commandments and obeying thy holy will in all things. Wherefore, direct my steps, O God, and fill my heart with thy grace. I seek to please thee alone, for thou art my Creator and my God. Preserve me from pride and self-love. Let reason, modesty and chastity adorn me. Deliver me from idleness which is hateful unto thee and breedeth vice; grant me to be diligent and fruitful in labor, and bless thou my work. Thy law commandeth that husband and wife live in chaste matrimonial union. Wherefore lead me, Holy Father, to this blessed calling not for the satisfaction of passions but unto the fulfillment of thy commandment; for thou hast said that it is not good that man should be alone and, having created woman as his companion, thou didst bless them to be fruitful and multiply that they may fill the earth. Hear my humble prayer which ascendeth unto thee from the depths of my heart: Grant unto me an honest and pious spouse that, through our love and harmony, we may together serve and praise thee, our compassionate God, and do thy will and bless thine all-holy name, of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen.
