A Prayer of Single Persons 

O Lord, who hast set forth for us an example of perfect purity, strengthen me, I beseech thee, when temptation doth beset me, and when strong passions seek to overwhelm me, that I may remain constant in virtue and innocent in thought, word, and deed, doing only such things as are well-pleasing to thee. Grant me growth in wisdom and understanding, that I may serve thee in holiness all the days of my life, through the intercessions of thine all-immaculate Mother and of all thy saints, especially my patron saint N. Amen.
