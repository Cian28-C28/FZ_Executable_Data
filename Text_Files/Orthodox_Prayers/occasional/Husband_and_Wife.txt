A Prayer of Husband and Wife 

O merciful God, we beseech thee ever to remind us that the married state is holy and that we must keep it so. Grant us thy grace, that we may continue in faithfulness and love. Increase in us the spirit of mutual understanding, forgiveness, patience and trust, that no quarrel or strife may come between us. Grant us thy blessings, that we may serve thee in holiness and gladness of heart all the days of our lives. And finally, by thy mercy, account us worthy of everlasting life. For thine it is to save us, O our God, and unto thee we ascribe glory, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.
