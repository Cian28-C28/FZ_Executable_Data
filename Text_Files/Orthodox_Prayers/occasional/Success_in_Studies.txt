A Prayer for Success in Studies 

O Lord our God, who hast honored man with thine image divine and endowed him with reason, and who givest wisdom to those who ask: Do thou thyself now look down upon me, thy servant, and enlighten my mind and establish my heart to receive instruction, to be diligent in study and to achieve good success, with the aid of thy divine grace. Grant that I may employ my learning unto every good work and follow thy holy and perfect will, favorably unto thy good pleasure. For thou art our God, and to thee do we offer up glory, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.
