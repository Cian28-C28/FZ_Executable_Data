Prayer Before a Journey (If no priest is present to bless the traveler.) 

O Lord Jesus Christ our God, the true and living way, be thou, O Master, my companion, guide and guardian during my journey; deliver and protect me from all danger, misfortune and temptation, that, being so defended by thy divine power, I may have a peaceful and successful journey and arrive safely at my destination. For in thee I put my trust and hope, and to thee, together with thine eternal Father and thine all-holy Spirit, I ascribe all praise, honor and glory, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.
