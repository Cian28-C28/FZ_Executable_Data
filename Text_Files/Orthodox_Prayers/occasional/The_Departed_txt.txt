A Prayer for the Departed 

Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend the souls of thy servants, NN., and beseech thee to grant them rest with thy saints, where the light of thy countenance shineth forever. I beseech thee also to grant that our present lives may be godly, sober and blameless, that we also may be made worthy to enter into thy heavenly kingdom with those we love who have gone to their rest before us. For thou art the Resurrection and the Life and the Repose of thy departed servants, O Christ our God, and unto thee do we ascribe glory, with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
