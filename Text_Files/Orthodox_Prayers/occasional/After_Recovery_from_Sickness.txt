Thanksgiving After Recovery from Sickness 

Almighty God, our heavenly Father, Source of life and Fountain of all good things, I bless thy holy name and offer to thee heartfelt thanks for having delivered me from my sickness and restored me to health. Grant me thy continuing grace, I pray thee, that I may keep my good resolutions and correct the errors of my former way of life, and that I may improve in virtue and live a new way of life in dutiful fear of thee, doing thy will in all things and devoting this new life which thou has given me to thy service, that thus living for thee, I may be found ready when it pleaseth thee to call me to thee, O heavenly Father, to whom, with thine ony-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and thine all-holy and life-giving Spirit, is due all honor, praise, glory and thanksgiving, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.
