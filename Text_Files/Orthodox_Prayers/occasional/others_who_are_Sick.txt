A Prayer for others who are Sick 

O holy Father, heavenly Physician of our souls and bodies, who hast sent thine only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, to heal all our infirmities and deliver us from death: Do thou thyself visit and heal thy servant(s), NN., granting him (her) release from pain and restoration to health and vigor, that he (she) may give thanks to thee and do thy will and bless thy holy name, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
