A Prayer for Purity 

O Master, Lord my God, in whose hands are my lots, help me according to thy mercy and do not allow me to be destroyed by mine iniquities, nor permit me by my will to follow the desires of my flesh against my spirit. I was fashioned by thee, do not forsake the works of thy hands. Turn not thy face away from me, have pity and do not despise me, neither forsake me, O Lord, for I am weak and it is to thee, my protecting God, that I have fled for refuge. Heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee. Save me for the sake of thy mercy, for upon thee have I cast myself from my very youth. May those who war against me be put to shame, and may those who seek to separate me from thee through immodest acts, unseemly thoughts and unprofitable recollections be turned back. Chase far from me every impurity, that foul effluence of evil. For thou alone art holy, thou alone art mighty, thou alone art immortal, having unfathomable power against all things, and it is through thee that every power is given against the devil and his might. For unto thee are due all glory, honor and worship, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
