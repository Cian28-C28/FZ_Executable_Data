A Prayer for Soldiers 

O holy Master, Father almighty, who alone hast authority over all things: We entreat thee with compunction that, as thou didst grant unto thy servant David the power to defeat Goliath and protection against his adversaries, so in like manner, now also thou wouldst grant protection to thy servants against every evil circumstance, calamity and foe, by thy right hand omnipotent. Through thy heavenly mercy, preserve them in righteousness, faith, truth and the fear of thee, that thereby they may serve honorably and justly. Send thy protecting angels, that they may return home again in peace and safety. For thou art our God, and to thee do we offer up glory, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.
