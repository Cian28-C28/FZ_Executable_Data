Prayer for Those Struggling with Depression 

O greatly-merciful Master, Lord Jesus Christ my God, have mercy on me and cleanse me from all defilement of body and soul. Drive away from me every spiritually crushing and demonic sorrow. Restore in me the joy of thy salvation, for thou art the true joy and the hope of all the ends of the earth and of them that be far off at sea; therefore, be merciful unto me, O Master, and set aright my mind and strengthen my heart. Take from me the heavy burden of sin and despair. Drive far away from me the spirit of depression, fear, anxiety, listlessness, cowardice and every disturbance of mind. Confirm me in thy love, in unassailable hope and unshakable faith in thee, through the intercessions of thine immaculate Mother and all thy saints. Amen.
