Prayer upon Entering a Church 

In the multitude of thy mercy I shall go into thy house; I will worship toward thy holy temple in fear of thee. O Lord, guide me in the way of thy righteousness; because of mine enemies, make straight my way before thee, that with a clear mind I may glorify thee forever, One Godhead worshipped in three Persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen.
