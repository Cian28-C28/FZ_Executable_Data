Prayers After Confession


1.

O almighty and merciful God, I truly thank thee for the forgiveness of my sins; bless me, O Lord, and help me always, that I may ever do that which is pleasing to thee and sin no more. Amen.

2.

O Lord God of my salvation, the Saviour and Benefactor of my soul, I am truly sorry for mine every transgression, and I firmly resolve with thy help never again to offend thee by sins, and I sincerely promise to amend my way of life. Implant in me the fear of thy blessed commandments, that I may trample down all fleshly desires and may lead a godly way of life, both thinking and doing always such things as are pleasing to thee. I pray thee, grant unto me the grace of thy Holy Spirit, that being strengthened thereby, I may shun all evil deeds and works and words and thoughts, and that I may avoid all snares of the evil one. Shine in my heart the true Sun of thy righteousness; enlighten my mind and guard all my senses, that walking uprightly in the way of thy commandments, I may attain unto life eternal. Amen.

3. 

O Sovereign Master, Lover of mankind, lead me in thy way, that I may walk in thy truth. Gladden my heart, that I may fear thy holy name. O Lord, mighty in mercy, gracious in strength, do thou help, comfort and save me, as I put my trust in thy holy name. Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy displeasure, neither chasten me in thy wrath, but show unto me thy great mercy and compassion, O Physician and Healer of my soul. O merciful Saviour, blot out all my transgressions, for I am heartily sorry for having offended thee. Grant me thy grace that I may avoid my previous evil ways. Strengthen me, O Mighty One, to withstand those temptations before which I am weak, that I may avoid all future sin. Keep me under thy protection and in the shadow of thy wings, that I may serve thee, praise thee and glorify thee all the days of my life. Amen.
