Seventh Ode

O taste and see that the Lord is good, who for our sake was made like unto us of old and once for all offered up himself as an offering to his Father and is now forever slain, sanctifying those who partake of him.

Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.

O Master, let me be sanctified in body and soul; let me be enlightened and saved; and let me become thy dwelling through the communion of the sacred mysteries, having thee, O most merciful Benefactor, living in me, with the Father and the Spirit.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

May thy precious Body and Blood, O my Savior, be as fire and light to me, consuming the substance of sin and burning the tares of my passions and wholly enlightening me, that I may worship thy divinity.
