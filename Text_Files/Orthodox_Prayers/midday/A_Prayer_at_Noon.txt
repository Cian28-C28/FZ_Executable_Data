A Prayer at Noon

O Christ our God, who at this hour didst stretch out Thy loving arms upon the Cross that all men might be gathered unto Thee, help us and save us who cry out unto Thee: Glory to Thee, O Lord.

[Here may be added your own private devotions and intercessions, using your own words or the "Occasional Prayers." When you have finished, conclude by saying:]

Through the prayers of our holy Fathers, Lord Jesus Christ our God, have mercy upon us and save us. Amen.â€‹
