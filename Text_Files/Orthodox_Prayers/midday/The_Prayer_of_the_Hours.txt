The Prayer of the Hours

O Christ our God, Who art worshipped and glorified at all times at every hour both in heaven and on earth; Who art long-suffering and plenteous in mercy and compassion; Who lovest the just man and showest mercy upon the sinner; and Who callest all men to repentance through the promise of blessings to come; receive, O Lord, at this very hour our supplications, and direct our lives in the way of Thy commandments: sanctify our souls, purify our bodies, set our minds aright, cleanse our thoughts; deliver us from all affliction, trouble, and distress; compass us about with Thy holy angels, that, guided and guarded by them, we may attain unto the unity of the Faith, and to the knowledge of Thine unapproachable glory; for Thou art blessed unto ages of ages. Amen.
