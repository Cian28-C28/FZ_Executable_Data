The Jesus Prayer

Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.

[Repeat as desired]

The Jesus Prayer is traditionally repeated many times as part of a personal prayer rule or as a form of meditation. It is often prayed with the aid of a prayer rope.

The prayer can also be shortened to:
"Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me."

Or even further to:
"Lord, have mercy."

When praying for others, it can be modified to:
"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us."

Or for a specific person:
"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on Thy servant [name]."
