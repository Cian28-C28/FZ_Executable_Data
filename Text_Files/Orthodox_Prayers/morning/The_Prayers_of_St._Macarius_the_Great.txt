The Prayers of St. Macarius the Great

First Prayer

O God, cleanse me, a sinner, for I have never done anything good in thy sight. Deliver me from the evil one, and may thy will be in me, that I may open my unworthy mouth without condemnation and praise thy holy name, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen. 

Second Prayer 

Having risen from sleep, I offer thee, O Saviour, the midnight song and fall down and cry unto thee: grant me not to fall asleep in the death of sin, but have compassion on me, O thou who wast voluntarily crucified, and hasten to raise me who am prostrate in idleness, and save me in prayer and intercession, and after the nightâ€™s sleep, bless me with a sinless day, O Christ our God, and save me. 

Third Prayer 

Having risen from sleep, I hasten to thee, O Lord, Lover of men, and by thy loving-kindness I strive to do thy works, and I pray to thee: help me at all times, in everything, and deliver me from every evil thing of the world and every attack of the devil, and lead me into thine eternal kingdom. For thou art my Creator, the Giver and Protector of everything good, and all my hope is in thee. And to thee I send up glory, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen. 

Fourth Prayer 

O Lord, who in thine abundant goodness and thy great compassion hast granted me, thy servant, to pass the time of this night without the temptation of any opposing evil, Lord and Creator of all, by thy true light and with an enlightened heart grant me to do thy will, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen. 

Fifth Prayer 

Almighty Lord God, who dost receive from thy heavenly powers the thrice-holy hymn, receive also from me, thine unworthy servant, this song of the night, and grant me every year of my life and at every hour to send up glory to thee, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.
