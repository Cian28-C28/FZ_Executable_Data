A Prayer for the Beginning of the Day
by St. Philaret of Moscow

O Lord, grant me thy peace to greet all this day is to bring. Grant me the grace to surrender myself completely to thy holy will. In every hour of this day instruct and guide me in all things. Whatever tidings I may receive in this day, teach me to accept tranquilly, in the firm belief that thy holy will governs all. Govern thou my thoughts and feelings in all that I do and say. When unforeseen things occur, let me not forget that all is sent by thee. Teach me to behave sincerely and reasonably towards everyone, that I may bring confusion and sorrow to no one. Bestow on me, O Lord, strength to endure the fatigue of the day, and to bear my part in its events. Guide thou my will. Teach me how to pray. Pray thou thyself within me. Amen.
